## Route Security

Currently all routes are public. Consider securing them to require authentication and authorization soon.

## Boilerplate

There's a lot of very clean and perfect boilerplate code in this repo. You probably have more routes and controllers than you will need. That's fine for now but soon the relationships between the models need to be defined and after that the routes and controllers need to be modified to reflect the actual structure of the database.
